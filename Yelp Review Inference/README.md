Project Summary

In this project, I will perform a yelp review inference by bringing together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically, I will:

* Load yelp review dataset
* Load a pre-trained model (GPT2) and evaluate its performance
* Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning (LORA) using the pre-trained model
* Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
